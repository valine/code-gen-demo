# Northbound Loaded Dice

This repository hosts a gag dice web app that forces a fixed roll when a device is pointed north.

## Local development

Open `index.html` in a modern mobile browser to experiment with the compass-powered dice roller. When testing
orientation features, use a real device or an emulator that supports DeviceOrientation events.

## Deployment

The site is a single static HTML file. To publish it with GitHub Pages, open the repository **Settings** >
**Pages**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, and select the `main` branch with the `/ (root)` folder. Saving that
configuration makes Pages serve the latest commit automaticallyâ€”no build or workflow files are required.
